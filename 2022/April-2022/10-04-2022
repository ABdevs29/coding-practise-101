Q) Diagonal Difference
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
For example, the square matrix  is shown below:
1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9  
The left-to-right diagonal = . The right to left diagonal = . Their absolute difference is .
Function description
Complete the  function in the editor below.
diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:
int arr[n][m]: an array of integers
Return
int: the absolute diagonal difference
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer, , the number of rows and columns in the square matrix . 
Each of the next  lines describes a row, , and consists of  space-separated integers .

Soln)
function diagonalDifference(arr) {
    let sum1 = 0;
    let sum2 = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        sum1 += arr[i][i];
        sum2 += arr[i][arr.length - 1 - i];
    };
    return Math.abs(sum1 - sum2);
}
