1) Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with places after the decimal.
Note: This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with absolute error of up to  are acceptable.
Example 

There are  elements, two positive, two negative and one zero. Their ratios are ,  and . Results are printed as:
0.400000
0.400000
0.200000
Function Description
Complete the plusMinus function in the editor below.
plusMinus has the following parameter(s):
int arr[n]: an array of integers
Print 
Print the ratios of positive, negative and zero values in the array. Each value should be printed on a separate line with  digits after the decimal. The function should not return a value.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer, , the size of the array. 
The second line contains  space-separated integers that describe .
Constraints
 

Output Format
Print the following  lines, each to  decimals:
proportion of positive values
proportion of negative values
proportion of zeros
Sample Input
STDIN           Function
-----           --------
6               arr[] size n = 6
-4 3 -9 0 4 1   arr = [-4, 3, -9, 0, 4, 1]
Sample Output
0.500000
0.333333
0.166667
Explanation
There are  positive numbers,  negative numbers, and  zero in the array. 
The proportions of occurrence are positive: 

Soln:
function plusMinus(arr) {
    let positive = 0;
    let negative = 0;
    let zero = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (+arr[i] >= 1) {
            positive++;
        } else if (+arr[i] <= -1) {
            negative++;
        } else {
            zero++;
        }
    }
    let sum = positive + negative + zero;
    console.log((positive/sum).toFixed(6));
    console.log((negative/sum).toFixed(6));
    console.log((zero/sum).toFixed(6));
}


2) Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.
Example 

The minimum sum is  and the maximum sum is . The function prints
16 24
Function Description
Complete the miniMaxSum function in the editor below.
miniMaxSum has the following parameter(s):
arr: an array of  integers
Print
Print two space-separated integers on one line: the minimum sum and the maximum sum of  of  elements.
Input Format
A single line of five space-separated integers.
Constraints

Output Format
Print two space-separated long integers denoting the respective minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. (The output can be greater than a 32 bit integer.)
Sample Input
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output
10 14
Explanation
The numbers are , , , , and . Calculate the following sums using four of the five integers:
Sum everything except , the sum is .
Sum everything except , the sum is .
Sum everything except , the sum is .
Sum everything except , the sum is .
Sum everything except , the sum is .
Hints: Beware of integer overflow! Use 64-bit Integer.

Soln:
function miniMaxSum(arr) {
    arr.sort();
    let minSum = 0;
    let maxSum = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
        minSum += +arr[i];
    }
    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        maxSum += +arr[i];
    }
    console.log(minSum, maxSum);
    
}
